This binary file is downloaded from Microsoft at:
https://azurecliprod.blob.core.windows.net/msi/azure-cli-latest.msi

Previous versions are available at a numbered version e.g.:
https://azurecliprod.blob.core.windows.net/msi/azure-cli-2.0.26.msi

Due to the fact that this is a "latest" build and is not numbered,
the package maintainer simply downloads the file from that location, 
renames it, and includes it in the package.
